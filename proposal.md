>#### The Trivia Game That Lets You *Bet* On The Answers!
## Project Description
My app is called $mart Money! It's a trivia game for players that want to test their game show prowess online. The player can begin answering questions while betting their own prize money on getting a correct answer. The game tracks your earnings, and in the future I would like the game to let you compare your total winnings against a leaderboard of all-time high scores, as well as implement a "Lightning Round" that rewards more cash for faster answers!
